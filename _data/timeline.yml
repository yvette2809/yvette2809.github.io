  description: I built a pipeline from data integration and cleaning to model selection 
               and evaluation to predict debtors’ repay possibility and conditional liquidation 
               rate for an internal project. In the daily work supporting my client at American 
               Express, I wrote SQL queries on a daily basis to extract data, perform analyses 
               and create reports. I also automated multiple report-generating processes by 
               writing Python scripts, which greatly reduce the monthly manual efforts.

  description: I took _Python_ and _Analytics in Practice_, and I built up my Python programming 
               skills through the coursework and hands-on experience with real-world data. 
               In Simulation and Deep Learning courses, I further honed my programming skills 
               by designing queueing algorithms and training Neural Network models in Python. 
               I was a TA for Columbia online course Analytics in Python (EdX course), helping 
               write grading codes for assignments and holding virtual Q&A sessions to answer 
               students’ questions about coursework.
