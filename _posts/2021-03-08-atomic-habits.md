### Chapter 1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits

--------
1. Small changes often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold. The most powerful outcomes of any compounding process are delayed. You need to be patient.

2. If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead.

3. You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.

    <td>Productivity compounds - automate an old task or master a new skill. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Knowledge compounds - new knowledge opens up different ways of thinking about old ideas. </td>
    <td>Negative thoughts compounds - negative thoughts tend to make you interpret life that way.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Relationship compounds - helping others is helping yourself.</td>
